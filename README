OpenBOR (anallyst edition)
--------------------------

ABOUT THIS GIT REPO
===================
this git-repository has both the anallyst version of
OpenBOR (branch master) and the "official" version
from Chronocrash (former Lavalit) from SVN in branch svn.

The anallyst edition was forked off from SVN revision
3233 and was kept in sync with lavalit until rev 3318.

Differences:
the anallyst version is heavily optimized, debloated and 
debugged and runs much faster than the lavalit version.
it has also a lot of platform-specific junk stripped off.
unlike the official version, this version is able to play
extracted mods directly from a directory.
this makes it much easier to debug and improve them.

the lavalit version has more bugs and some new features
which are not in mainstream usage.
some of the new features that were encountered in real-world
mods were backported to the anallyst version.
the anallyst edition should be able to play 99% of available
mods, after unpacking and repacking them with borpak from this
repo (see below).


the history of this git repo lasts back until SVN REV 3020,
at which point the repo was split into 2 parts.
the official svn repo is broken and it is not possible to
retrieve earlier commits.
the history was slightly edited with automatic tools to 
remove all embedded binaries 
(except of the required resources like .png's).
the original had a lot of cruft in the tools directory
(entire tarballs of toolchains, svn-setup.exe, etc.)
adding these to this git repo would make it about 100x bigger
and thus slower to use, so they were omitted.
also automatically generated changes to version.h, meta.xml
and Info.plist were removed from the commits (version numbers
generated by make), as those just make it harder to see the
relevant information.


BUILD
=====
just run:

make

an executable of the name "OpenBOR" will be created.

possible flags to make:

NO_GL=1 BUILD_DEBUG=1 make #will build without opengl but with debugging support

OpenBOR directory layout:
      -> OpenBOR       (executable)
      -> Paks/         (put paks or directories with extracted paks)
      -> ScreenShots/

      -> Saves/

ABOUT
=====

OpenBOR is a continuation of the Beats Of Rage 2D game engine, which was originally
created by http://www.senileteam.com.

this is a fork of "official OpenBOR" (i.e. from lavalit forums) 
by rofl0r aka anallyst, former "OpenBOR team" member.

his work on OpenBOR started back with SVN rev ~2900.
he left the lavalit team due to internal differences after SVN rev 3318 and 
started his own fork.

instead of adding features over features, it is the intent to strip off
unnecesary stuff and simplify things,
while staying compatible to the existing mods and POSIX.

a possible idea is to add lua scripting support at some point in the future,
and the ugly and slow "C script" interpreter code can be removed and the
good mods be converted to lua.

Current Situation/Comparison with "official" OpenBOR
====================================================
PAKS:
  since the commit tagged "pak-change" the internal layout of
  .pak files has changed to simplify things.
  filenames are stored in unix fashion (/) and lowercase only.
  to make old pak files compatible, they have to be "converted":

  extract them using the borpak tool in tools/borpak,
  then repack them using the same tool.
  this results in a fresh pak in the required format.

  this change made it possible to use extracted paks in a directory.
  you can simply create a directory in the Paks dir for each game
  (i.e. Paks/MyGame/data/)

BLOAT:
  OpenBOR (anallyst edition) x64 binary           :  750 KB
  OpenBOR (lavalit edition, rev 3320)  x64 binary : 1250 KB
  OpenBOR (lavalit edition, rev 3600+) x64 binary : probably 1.5 MB+

SPEED:
  anallysts work on OpenBOR made for huge speed improvements in loading times.
  most mods now load in an instant and took several seconds (up to minutes (!))
  formerly.
  this improvements have gone into the lavalit version as well, but some team
  members there prefer seeing a moving loading bar between levels over instant
  loading, so some of the optimisations has been removed by them.
  it's likely that the lavalit version will get slower and slower over time.
  
  this fork is currently the fastest openbor version available.
  
MOD COMPATIBILITY:
  some upstream features have been ported so mods relying on OpenBOR 36xx features
  should work exactly as intended.

  compatibility to older mods should be even better as the lavalit version
  as some bugs have been fixed that prevented some mods to work with anything
  newer than rev 28xx.

PLATFORMS:
  support for any non-posix compatible game console has been removed.
  this fork builds well on any posix compatible platform that has ports
  of libogg/vorbis and SDL.
  this means it should build on any linux based device, *BSD, etc.
  possibly even mingw.
  we're taking the stance that instead of buying a commercial game console to
  crack it for homebrew usage, you should rather buy products that are intended
  for homebrewers and thus support the companies producing them.
